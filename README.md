## Version Control System

This is a project created after completing the ["Version Control System"](https://hyperskill.org/projects/177) course from the [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/tracks) company(via **JetBrains**), which performs work on versioning files in the system.

It's works using arguments via the console. There are 5 types of arguments:
> - ``--help``
> - ``config 'username'``
> - ``add 'filePath'``
> - ``commit 'commitMessage'``
> - ``log``
> - ``checkout 'hashString'``
